This is my personal readme where I document how I am deviating from the original repo. 

- I forked the original repo and cloned this to my local machine. 
- I created a virtual environment called stockanalytics to practice creating venvs - I have to remember to activate it each time, I think. This is a achieved by

<code>stockanalytcs/bin/activate</code>
